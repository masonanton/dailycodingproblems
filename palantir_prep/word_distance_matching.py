# Given a string of space-separated words, a two-word query, and a max distance k,
# return all pairs of indices [i, j] such that:
#   - The first query word appears at index i
#   - The second query word appears at index j
#   - |i - j| <= k
#
# Example:
# text = "The quick fox is a quick brown fox"
# query = "quick fox"
# k = 2
# Output: [[1, 2], [5, 7]]
