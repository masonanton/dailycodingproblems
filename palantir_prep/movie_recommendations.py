# Movie Recommendation System
#
# There are n users. Each user likes a range of movies, given by the segment [l_i, r_i] (inclusive).
# A user j is a predictor for user i (where j != i) if the range [l_j, r_j] fully contains [l_i, r_i] and [l_j, r_j] â‰  [l_i, r_i].
# A movie is strongly recommended to user i if:
#   - The movie is not already liked by user i (i.e., not in [l_i, r_i]), and
#   - The movie is liked by every predictor of user i (i.e., in the intersection of all predictors' ranges).
# For each user, compute the number of strongly recommended movies.
# If a user has no predictors, output 0 for that user.
#
# Input:
#   n (number of users)
#   n lines, each with two integers l_i and r_i
#
# Output:
#   n integers: the i-th is the number of strongly recommended movies for user i.
#
# Example:
# Input:
#   3
#   3 8
#   2 5
#   4 5
#
# Output:
#   0 0 1
#
# Implement the function below:
