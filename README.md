# Daily Coding Problems

This repository contains my solutions to daily data structures and algorithms (DSA) coding challenges from [DailyCodingProblem.com](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com).

## About

Every day, I receive a new coding problem via email from DailyCodingProblem.com. These problems are designed to improve problem-solving skills and cover a wide range of computer science concepts.

## Repository Structure

Each problem has its own directory containing:

- `solution.py`: My solution to the problem.
- `test_solution.py`: Pytest-based unit tests to verify correctness.

Example structure:

```bash
ðŸ“‚ dailycodingproblems
